## TODO

@Yunhu

- Add more API retrieved function for the Riot Class, for example retrieve matches, top comps, tops augments, etc..
- For instance, make an request to pull the most used champions to get top1, the most composition, most augments.
- Organized the retrieved data, figure it out which one should we use, which one should not.
- For now lets just uniform the server, we will only working on EUW1 server so every api request we made will be pulled from EUW server.

@Phicks
