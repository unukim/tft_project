# USE THE TEST MODEL

To run and play with the test model. Open your terminal and run the "modelplaygroundTest.py" inside the model folder.

Remember to install all the library first.

Run the file and it will show you the model training process, eventually you will see the model getting better and better.

## TODO

@Yunhu

- Changing the class name to Captalized, right now you use camel toes.
- Reorganized the file to become more organize. Combine all the files into the folder model side.
- Make an gloabal API so that when I used the model, I can just call the global API, restricted the user accessibility. (ask me if you don't understand this)

- Clustering data

@Phicks

- Build the PPO model using tensorflow.
- Making the client side running
